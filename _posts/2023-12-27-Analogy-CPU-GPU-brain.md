In the technological landscape, an intriguing analogy unfolds between computer components and the human brain's architecture.

The CPU, foundational to traditional computing systems, is analogous to the subcortical structures of the brain. These subcortical areas, evolutionarily older and essential for basic life functions, parallel the CPU in handling core computing tasks and basic operations.

Advancing to a higher level of complexity, GPUs can be seen as analogous to specific regions of the cerebral cortex in the human brain. Each GPU, equipped with numerous cores, executes a single instruction across multiple data points. This mirrors the function of a particular region in the cerebral cortex, where groups of mini-columns uniformly process specific types of information. Similarly, each core within a GPU processes data in parallel, akin to how each mini-column in a brain region performs its function uniformly.

Different GPUs in a computing system, each designated for distinct computational tasks, represent the diverse specialized regions of the cerebral cortex, such as those dedicated to visual or auditory processing. The interconnections between these GPUs are akin to the brain's white matter, which comprises dense axon bundles that facilitate integrated communication and coordination between different cortical areas. This integration enables high-level problem-solving and cognitive functionality, akin to how interconnected GPUs, each with different functionalities, collectively contribute to a system's advanced problem-solving capabilities. Future work in this area is promising, particularly in developing methods for the automatic and optimal assembly of GPUs with varying functionalities into an integrated system, a challenge that remains open.

Through this analogy, the CPU's role as a foundational and versatile processor reflects the vital functions of the brain's subcortical structures, while GPUs embody the specialized, parallel processing capabilities of the cerebral cortex. The interconnected nature of GPUs with differing functionalities echoes the brain's complex communication pathways, which are essential for integrated, high-level functions.
