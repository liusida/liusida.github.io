title: Implement a Deep Neural Network using Python and Numpy
---

I have just finished [Andrew Ng's new Coursera courses of Deep Learning (1-3)][1]. They are one part of his new project [DeepLearning.ai][2].

In those courses, there is a series of interview of [Heroes of Deep Learning][3], which is very helpful for a newbie to enter this field. I heard several times those masters require a newbie to build a whole deep network from scratch, maybe just use Python and Numpy, to understand things better. So, after the courses, I decided to build one on my own.

## Day 1

I create a new repository named [Deep Scratch][4] in github, and a [main.ipynb][5] file, to do this job.

First of all, I made a todo list, those are functions or algorithms metioned in the courses. I planed to implement most of them.

Second, I decided to begin with MNIST dataset. It is the Hello, World dataset. But I will switch to other dataset to test my model. In my mind, maybe too ambitious, I want to build a transferable model, I think that's the correct direction to general thinking.

After these, I can now start this project.

## Day 2

to be continue...
