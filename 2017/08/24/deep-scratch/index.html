  <h1>Implement a Deep Neural Network using Python and Numpy</h1>
  <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2017</span>
  <p>I have just finished <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Andrew Ng’s new Coursera courses of Deep Learning (1-3)</a>. They are one part of his new project <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">DeepLearning.ai</a>.</p>

<p>In those courses, there is a series of interview of <a href="https://youtu.be/-eyhCTvrEtE?list=PLfsVAYSMwsksjfpy8P2t_I52mugGeA5gR">Heroes of Deep Learning</a>, which is very helpful for a newbie to enter this field. I heard several times those masters require a newbie to build a whole deep network from scratch, maybe just use Python and Numpy, to understand things better. So, after the courses, I decided to build one on my own.</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

<p>I create a new repository named <a href="https://github.com/liusida/DeepScratch">Deep Scratch</a> in github, and a <a href="https://github.com/liusida/DeepScratch/blob/master/main.ipynb">main.ipynb</a> file, to do this job.</p>

<p>First of all, I made a todo list, those are functions or algorithms metioned in the courses. I planed to implement most of them.</p>

<p>Second, I decided to begin with MNIST dataset. It is the Hello, World dataset. But I will switch to other dataset to test my model. In my mind, maybe too ambitious, I want to build a transferable model, I think that’s the correct direction to general thinking.</p>

<p>After these, I can now start this project.</p>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

<p>I implemented a basic model, including those functions:</p>

<p>I had to say, the math is complex for me. When I implemented first time, I almost have 10 bugs in calculation!</p>

<p>There are a few unconcrete concepts, such as what loss function should I use for multi-class classification? What is the derivative of softmax? When should I divide the result by m (the number of examples)?</p>

<p>After maybe 10 hours of debug, I even implement a bunch of tensorflow alternative functions, finally, the model work out!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liusida/DeepScratch/blob/day2/main.ipynb">Day 2’s notebook</a> &lt;- Here is the code and formula. (I found that Jupyter Notebook is great to comment codes!)</p>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>

<p>The training set accuracy was already 1.0, so I looked at the dev set accuracy: 0.6? Oh, that’s bad. So I had a variance problem.</p>

<p>I tried to implement regularization, but seems had little help to this variance problem.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I figured out why: because I use random batch to train, the distribution of random batch can not cover all training examples, so I wasted a lot of training examples.</p>

<p>So I changed to mini-batch, which define a mini-batch size, every time use a segment of training data, so it can sure every single example was used for training.</p>

<p>And I also realize a very interesting aspect of mini-batch, it has a very good effect to variance problem, especially when the network is relatively shallow. I think it acts just like dropout! The network can not depend on any single data!</p>

<p>Thanks to mini-batch, my dev accuracy jumped to 0.98, and test set accuracy was also 0.98. Not bad for today’s work!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liusida/DeepScratch/blob/day3/main.ipynb">Day 3’s notebook</a> &lt;- Here is mini-batch, regularization, train/dev/test accuracy.</p>
