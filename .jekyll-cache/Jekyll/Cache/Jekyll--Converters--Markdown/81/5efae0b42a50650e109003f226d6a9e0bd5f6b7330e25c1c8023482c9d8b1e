I"O<p>Imagine that we have designed an computational experiment in Python, and we waited 3 days for the results, and after that, unfortunately we discovered there was a typo or a small bug in the source code. What do you think we would say when we restart the experiment? I would hope that the experiment could be run in half a hour.</p>
